This example is a fork of the famous [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com/) and is probably one of the [smallest](https://github.com/bredele/lego-examples/tree/master/src/todos) and fastest. In average, it is 22 times faster than Backbone.

  > **Tips**: type **`todo 200 foo`** in the console to create 200 items with the label foo. The console will print the benchmark score.
